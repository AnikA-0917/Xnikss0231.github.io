            <p>Here’s a little throwback to my school journey:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><h2>Preschool</h2>
<div class="image-container">
            <img src="Preschool.jpg" alt="Preschool">
                    <p>Honestly, preschool was just vibes. It was easy at the time but I don’t remember much of it. I learned my ABCs, made random crafts. It was all about having fun and making friends.</p>
                </li>

                <li><h2>Elementary</h2>
<div class="image-container">
            <img src="Elementary.jpg" alt="Elementary">
                    <p>This is when things started getting hard—math, group projects, and discovering that I actually liked art. I was that kid who doodled all over their notebooks instead of paying attention. In the end, I failed some of my subjects.</p>
                </li>

                <li><h2>Junior High School</h2>
                    <p>JHS was a mix of chaos and glow-ups. The schoolwork got harder, but so did my passion for Visual Arts. I spent hours sketching, trying new styles, and wondering if I could actually turn this into something more. It’s where I started figuring myself out.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="Section.jpg" alt="Bestfriends">
            <p>My journey in 10 SPA as a Visual Arts student has been an incredible experience filled with creativity and growth. My classmates are wonderful, making every day more exciting and inspiring. I have two real best friends who have been with me through everything. Back in Grade 9, I had only one best friend, but she left me because she was scared of my dad. It was a painful experience, but in the end, I found true friendship. The two real besties I have now became my friends, and over time, our bond grew even stronger. They've shown me what real friendship looks like—supporting, understanding, and always there no matter what.</p>
