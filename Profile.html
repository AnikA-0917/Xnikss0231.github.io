    <p>Hi, I'm Anika Gabrielle C. Lopez. I created this webpage because our ICT teacher assigned us to do this. Here's a little information about me: I'm 15 years old, and my birthday is on September 17, 2009. My favorite colors are Blue, White, and Khaki. My current favorite subject is ICT because its all about coding im kinda computer geek so yeah, i have passion for Painting i love painting and drawing it speaks my emotion state like for example if im sad ill draw some things, oh and fun fact about me my Anika name came from barbie and a magic pegasus movie and my mom always eat Siomai when i was in her tummy. I'm the third daughter among my siblings. I have a pet dog named Atlasâ€”he is 1 year old, his breed is American Bully, and he is the sweetest dog. He's cute like a seal, lel :D.</p>
