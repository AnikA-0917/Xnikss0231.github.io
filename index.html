            <p>Here are my hobbies to fill this gap up hehe:</p>
            <br>
            <p>My hobbies are painting, drawing, rollerblading, playing badminton, and chatting with friends and cousins. I'm closer to my friends, but we have a special bond when it comes to cousins. I discovered painting and drawing when I was 5 years old. I guess I got my talent from my mom because she loves to paint too! :p</p>
